        <h3>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h3>
        <p>
          After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest
          on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to
          relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.

        <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
        <p>
          You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of
          flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of
          dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust
          tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few
          tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will
          prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous
          golden color.

      </li>

        <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
        <p>
          You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it
          in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter
          which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working
          it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should
          have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch
          thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the
          sauce and toppings.
